This project is designed with the intent to improve public access to a variety of historic materials and to create a digital archive of past and present projects in Newark: old, new and renovated buildings, parks, planning and outdoor sculpture - anything of interest to the physical life of the city, its architecture, and its infrastructure. The archive includes plans of the city, architectural drawings, old photographs and postcards, rare books, articles in periodicals, monographs, exhibition catalogues, student projects, as well as links to other online resources.\nThe initial phase of this project was made possible thanks to generous support of The Bay and Paul Foundations and The Leavens Foundation. Additional support comes from the New Jersey Historical Commission and from the Investors Foundation."
